Identify a good target to jump to
Pick the simplest valid redirection:

Hidden “win”/“print_flag” function:

bash
nm -C ./ch15 | grep -Ei 'win|flag|secret'
objdump -d ./ch15 | less
Use the function’s start address.

Or call system("/bin/sh") via PLT (ret2libc style):

bash
objdump -d ./ch15 | grep system@plt
strings -tx ./ch15 | grep '/bin/sh'
If no “/bin/sh” in binary, you can:

Use libc addresses when ASLR is off (LD_PRELOAD or local libc), or

Place “/bin/sh” on the stack and pass its pointer as the first argument.

If there’s a function that prints the flag (no args), that’s the easiest.
